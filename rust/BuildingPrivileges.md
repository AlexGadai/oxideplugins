Sick of using having to find all tool cupboards?

players love to hide them inside walls!

players love to have multiple of them!

This will help you find all tool cupboards around you and give you there locations.

**Chat command:**

- /bdp => it will look in what building zones you are, give you where the tool cupboards are and who have access to them.


Carefull ... with latest rust it seems like we can't really spamm peoples chat ... so if you get spammed and can't see the results of this plugin, tell me, i'll add a print into players console.
