Ever get lost and think "Gee, wish there was some way to indicate where my base is"?  Well that's what this plugin does.


It's very basic at the moment, but it should do the job by displaying a beacon in the game world where you set it, so that you can always find your way back.


Commands:

**/setwp**  - This will set the location you will want to find later.
**/wp**  - This will toggle the display of the beacon.


Currently only supports 1 beacon per user.


Admin Commands:

**/wpcount**  - Display count of currently set beacons.
**/wpshowall**  - Toggles the display of all of the player-set beacons.
**/wpadmin**  - Creates an admin beacon at your location that will display to all players on the server.

*** Known issues:


[Fixed by version 1.0.3 on 5/2]** Reloading this plugin will cause an issue with previously saved beacon locations for players and force them to reset their beacon location.
