Do you also hate that right clicking and left clicking thing, when upgrade base from TWIGS to STONE? Well, no more.


This plugin get rid of that, so you only need to RIGHT CLICK and upgrade 1 wall, and it switches to upgrade mode, then you can simply keep left clicking on all walls, and it automatically upgrades them to tier which you've chosen manually. If you want to switch to default hammer mode, you must just left click same tier (or higher) wall again.

It still requires materials though, so it can't be abused.
**

Plugin in action:**


**Commands for players (underlined are defaults):**


* 
**/eh [show/hide]** - Hides or shows current hammer state as ICON.
* 
**/eh [enable/disable] **- Enables or disables plugin's functionality for user who has typed this command.
* 
**/eh help **- Displays list of all possible commands.
* 
**/eh timer [0/seconds] **- Time in which hammer goes back to default mode.

* /**eh msgs [show/hide] **- Show messages in chat about hammer state.



**Known issues:**


* None



**Future plans:**


* Add configuration, if player should have those materials needed for upgrade. (Free upgrade option)
* Add configuration, to disable ICON feature (SERVER-WIDE).
* Add permissions support, so you could allow only certain players to use this feature.
* Add localization.
* Fix bugs if there are any!
