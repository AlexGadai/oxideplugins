Well I did this a few weeks ago and i find it extremely useful to get names of new items or deployables etc, so i decided to share The only **command **is in console: grabname type name
**Types available**: item, deployable, animal and ingame
**In-game**: will loop in every entity deployed in your server and check if the name contains what you want.
