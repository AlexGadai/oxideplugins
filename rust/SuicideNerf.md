The current Rust behavior is to instantly kill you when using the kill console command. This plugin forces the player into bleedout when the kill command is used instead of directly killing him.


This puts a "slight" damper on suicide teleporters (not much, i know). And in hostage situations, it gives the hostage taker a chance to prevent suicides (he will basically have a 30 seconds window to help the hostage back up).
