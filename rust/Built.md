Built provides entity ownership information for entities while not being dependent on any external plugins that track ownership.


To check who built an entity, look at the entity and enter the chat command /built. By default the plugin will echo the name of the online or sleeping player that built the entity, but if you have DeadPlayersList installed, you'll also be able to see the names of dead players.


Looking at cupboards or turrets and entering /built also provides information on authorization.


To allow people to use this command, grant them the built.use permission.

By default, only the admin group is allowed to use /built.
