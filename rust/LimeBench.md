**This simple mod has the following features:**


- A **global crafting speed** multiplier (default 0.75 --- ie: 25% faster)

- A separate crafting speed **multiplier for gunpowder **(default 0.4 --- ie: 60% faster)

- A **additional (applied on top of the two others) crafting speed multiplier **applied only when the player has **access to a cupboard **(default 0.5 --- ie: 50% faster)

- Supports **instacrafting** (set any multiplier to 0)

- Supports **bulk instacrafting** (global or bench only); this setting makes instacraft really instant, emptying the full queue and giving you all produced items instantly

- **Minimum Auth Level **configurable for all multipliers/features

- **Blacklist **of item shortnames for **each multipler**


The multiplier is set when an item begins crafting and updated every time an item in the queue (stacked or single) finishes. This means that leaving the cupboard range will not affect the item currently being crafted, but all other items will loose the cupboard bonus unless the player returns to the cupboard range.


Note that having access to ANY cupboard in range will give the player the boost even if it is not the master cupboard.
