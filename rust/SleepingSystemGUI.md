Sleeping System GUI adds a twist of a role-play into Rust. I've also added a GUI under the food so the players will know when to sleep. There are 5 bars on the GUI and when the player will reach the red bar he will have to go to sleep. If he wont go to sleep his screen will flash every 25 seconds.

**Notes:**

- Each bar takes 7,5mins to disappear

- After 30 total minutes the screen will flash every 25 seconds

**Commands:**

/sleep => Makes the player to fall asleep and regenerates the GUI bars.
