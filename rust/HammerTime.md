This is a very simple plugin that allows you to increase or decrease how long a player can rotate and/or demolish their building blocks (walls, floors, stairs, etc.)


Setting it to 0 will disable the option entirely. Setting it to -1 will allow a player to use the option at any time.


Config (and Rust) by default allows a player to use these options for 600 seconds (10 minutes).

**NOTE:** This will only affect newly built structures, and not ones before installing this plugin.
