**Raid [Temporary]**

A temporary solution for the un-raidable bases in Rust.


Config Explanation:


* 
**Wood**:


* Enabled [true/false] - Enable or Disable the Wood HP factors

* DoorVactor - This controlls the Wooden doors HP factor
* WallsVactor - This controlls the other Wooden blocks HP factor

* **Stone:**


* Enabled [true/false] - Enable or Disable the Stone HP factors

* DoorVactor - This controlls the Stone doors HP factor
* WallsVactor - This controlls the other Stone blocks HP factor

* 
**MetalFloor**:


* Enabled [true/false] - Enable or Disable the Metal Floor HP fix
* Melee - Set how much HP should be returned from Melee hit
* Range - Set how much HP should be returned from Range hit     Increasing the values in the config will increase the damage dealt to the attacked objects however decreasing it will reduce the damage. 

     Take in mind this are a default values from my server which was tested for decent raidable damage. You can change them in the way you want. Just make shure you test the damage before saving any changes.

**NOTE 1:** The damage changer provided in this plugin take effect only for melee weapons.
**NOTE 2:** If Garry's update and fix this health regeneration issue this plugin will no longer be needed.

P.S. Report any problems or suggestions. I may change some options I may not. I didn't have the time to think through all the obstacles though it's should be working fine.
