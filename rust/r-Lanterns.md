Auto switch on & off lanterns when players enter a tool cupboard radius.

Supports multiple tool cupboard zones
**Commands:**

- /lanterns_on => switch all lanterns on

- /lanterns_off => switch all lanterns off

commands don't over ride the plugin, meaning that if you switch all lanterns to on, but a player leaves a zone, all the lanterns of the zone will switch off.
