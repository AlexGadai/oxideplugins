**This plugin currently and will not support most other chat mods. Such as BetterChat, MagicChat and such plugins like that. As most chat plugins use a hook that 2 plugins can't use at once unless coded correctly.**


This plugin will simply block any incoming spam from chat. For example when a player spams chat it will simply give that player a few warnings and block any of those messages from being sent.

**Command Usage:**

*Player Help*

/cwarnings --Tells the player how many warnings they have.

/chelp --Provides help for the plugin

*Admin Help*

/cwipeall --Wipes every player stats.

/cwipe (player) --Wipes that players stats.

**Available Config Options:**

````
WarningEnabled = true; //Default = true, if the warning system in this plugin is enabled.

WaitTillMsg = 5, //Default = 5, how long till a player can send a message(seconds)

MaxWarnings = 3, //Default = 3, how many warnings till a player is kick
````


**Whats to come:**


* Admin bypass system(To bypass the warning system if enabled.)
* Word Filter System(Similar to any word filter currently available.)
* Ability to change kick to a ban for (x time)
* And your suggestions and idea's.
