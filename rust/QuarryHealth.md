**Feedback**

Any feedback is welcome, whether it be ideas and suggestions, bug reports, or just to tell me I coded it wrong. Tell me what I did wrong, and I'll fix it. Want something new? If I can do it I will.

**Notes**


* **The healthbar on quarries, I believe, is client side so I can't change the display of the quarry, however the health values will still take, I promise!**


**Features**


* Allows you to set the health of quarries, to make them a bit easier to destroy. (Right now it takes 10 C4 to destroy a single quarry! That with the high drop rate, I bet your getting spammed with quarries! I sure did haha. This makes them more likely to be destroyed.)
