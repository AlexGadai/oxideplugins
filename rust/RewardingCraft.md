This little plugin will reward you for everything you craft. Each 100 item crafted, you will learn a new item in the same category. For example if you crafted 100 arrows you will learn how to craft a new item in the ammunition category.


The learned item is always an item in your current rarity level. you gain access to the next rarity level only if you learned everything from the current level.


This is my first plugin for Rust but so far I didn't find any big issues ;-)


In the next version, I'll focus on balancing the way you progress and I'll take category type, base cost and base crafting time into account instead of the arbitrary "100 items".


Enjoy !
