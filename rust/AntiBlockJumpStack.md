Stops players from building those towers made of blocks by just jumping and building underneath themselves.

The plugin will basically stop everyone from building while jumping, shouldn't be possible anyway 
And under certain circumstances it is possible to put a buildingblock on top of yourself so they could still do this so the plugin also stops players from building too close near themselves.
