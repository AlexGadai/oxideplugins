**Configuration :**


Set a start hour, minute and second for the raids to be enabled, and for the raids to be disabled.

It's real time based on the server timezone, not in-game time.

During this period, players will be able to damage buildings again.


You can also choose which days of the week you want the plugin to work. So if you want raids to be enabled all the week end, you just remove Saturday and Sunday from the config file.

Please let me know any problems you encounter with my plugin and all your ideas to improve the plugin.

Incoming : I'll try to add a system so players can make a war declaration to another player and his house will be raidable during X amount of time if he's online.
