As requested by my mate [@SCE CropCrop](http://oxidemod.org/members/9797/) from Battle Of The Best - PVP Tournaments


Don't like the fact a bolty doesn't 1 hit head shot with a metal facemask on?

Do you think that pistol's deal too much damage when shooting someones hand?

Then this is the plugin for you!


Its a simple plugin designed to scale damage from any weapon to any part of the victims body. This is for player versus player interactions only


You can edit this from within game using the chat commands, or through the config. All default values are set to 1.0 (100%/Normal damage)

**Chat Commands**
/scale list - Displays a list of available bone types
/scale weapon <shortname> <bone> <amount> - Scales damage for a weapon to a bone.

<shortname> - Weapon shortname

<bone> - The bodypart hit

<amount> - The percentage modifier. ex. 0.5 is half damage, 1.0 is standard, 2.2 is 220% damage

example command usage - "/scale weapon rifle.ak pelvis 2.5" This will scale damage dealt to the pelvis by a Assault Rifle to 250%
