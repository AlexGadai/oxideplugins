This is my first ever mod and it has been years since I coded.  I am trying to address the need for a Rust Admin Tool (RAT) that works from the console or Rusty for Admins that are not always in-game.


The Rust Admin Tool Healer or RATHealer provides:


- rathealer.heal <player name> - example rathealer.heal quicken

- rathealer.all - heals all players

- rathealer.list - list players on the server

**Note:** This mod will Heal, Hydrate, Feed, Cure, etc.


Feedback on improving or error handling or performance all welcome!!!
