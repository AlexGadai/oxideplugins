This plugin adds an in-game admin command (only for players set with ownerid) to modify the explosives on their server.


Both the damage and radius can be altered for both Timed Explosives and F1 Grenades.

**Available commands:**

/explosivedamage <type: timed|grenade> <value: percentage>

/explosiveradius <type: timed|grenade> <value: percentage>

/stickygrenades (toggles the status to have grenades stick to objects like the timed explosives do)

**Examples:**

Disable timed explosives damage: /explosivedamage timed 0

Deal 200% damage with grenades: /explosivedamage grenade 200

Double the explosion radius of grenades: /explosiveradius grenade 200
