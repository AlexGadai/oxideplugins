A basic plugin providing AOE repair functionality. Note that the normal repair cost is still applicable when you repair, you just don't have to repair each component individually.


Repair checks build privs in order to only allow repair where you can build. If you are in a building blocked zone, you can't repair - same as the standard repair behavior.


The functionality can be turned on or off by players. (/HandyMan on/off)

Players can check their HandyMan state using /HandyMan.

Help text is provided for HandyMan displaying the commands available to players with the relevant options.


Server owners can configure the following :


* Repair range for AOE - default is 50m
* Structures affected by AOE repair
* Default HandyMan state
