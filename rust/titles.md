**NOTE:**  The Newly written plugin has been released and can be found here: [http://oxidemod.org/resources/ranks-and-titles.830/](http://oxidemod.org/resources/ranks-and-titles.830/)


This Plugin Creates Player titles for users right now the titles go: [Player] [Mod] [Admin].


As of right now the plugin does not have a heavily advanced config only right now to support showing the regular [Player] tag or not. You'll notice some code to get groups information, right now this is considered not working; Meaning: You cannot use this plugin with the Groups plugin.


I am still working on making support but its proving rather difficult without having to modify the groups plugin itself (Since we both go after the player display name)

**Usage So far**


* /show - Disable player title, use again to renable player title - Currently Disabled for Tweaking/repair
* Config file is another location to manually edit this tag

**Change Tag Name**

The Config now supports title names they can be changed here

**Future Features**


* Integration with Groups
* More control via config file - DONE!
* Help
* More Commands
* Colored Titles
* More advanced or Custom Titles
* More Dynamic To support Extra titles (More than 3)
* Suggest more stuff!


Any questions feel free to ask away, I wanted to get this out there so anyone else that was curious about making plugins with Javascript as their main language could get a small idea of what its like. And I hope to release this as a much larger and more controlled plugin in the future. Feel free to use it for your own plugins, I just ask for a little credit and if you need help I'm more than willing to provide it.
