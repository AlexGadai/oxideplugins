**Anti Item Stack Duping**

Recently i notice a stack-dupe exploit which was increasing the players Wood, Stones, Metal and etc (mostly all stacking items) by double each time. Which was not only making the player cheat-exploit the stack items but also was causing lag and was the reason for some server freezes. So I've coded this plugin for my server and I think is a good idea to share with the community so we all can have some protection against those abusers.

**NOTE 1: **Sometimes might be incorrect detection if the player tries to drop the same stack he split within 1.3 sec.

**NOTE 2:** If Garry update and fix the exploit this plugin will no longer be needed.
