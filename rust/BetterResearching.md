**Feedback**

Any feedback is welcome, whether it be ideas and suggestions, bug reports, or just to tell me I coded it wrong. Tell me what I did wrong, and I'll fix it. Want something new? If I can do it I will.

**Notes**


* Research chance has been fixed, so 0.3 is the normal research chance. Lower it is makes it harder, higher it is the easier it is.
* Research Cost Fraction is a float. 1 means 100%, 0.5 means 50% and 0.0 means 0%. This value controls what percentage of resources is taken when researching. Does not effect paper.


**Features**


* Allows you to turn on instant researching.
* Allows you to increase or decrease the chance of failing.
* Allows you to control the amount of paper required to research.
* Allows you to control the percentage of resources taken when researching.



**Commands**
