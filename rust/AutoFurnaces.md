All this plugin does is when the server is started, all furnaces will be automatically turned on and begin cooking. This is done to fix the issue where when an admin restarts the server, all furnaces have to be re-started.
**Features**


* Turns all furnaces on and makes them start cooking on server start.
* Displays in the console the number of furnaces that were turned on.
* Now only turns on furnaces that actually have something cookable in them. Furnaces with only wood in them will not start.
