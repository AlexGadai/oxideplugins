This plugin will move any items you craft in the categories Weapon, Tool, Medical, Food, and Construction to your belt (hotbar, action bar, whichever you call it) if there is an open space. (Favoring the first spot) This is great if your in a firefight and your gun breaks. Just craft another one and run around like a chicken with your head cut off until it pops into your belt slot, then you can commence wrecking your enemies.
