Simply give a user permissions to access certain parts of being a admin. This will prevent your admins / mods from being able to spawn items or BPs or even using god mode and stop them using shift + l and shift + p, Make sure they are not set as owner or moderator with Rust. Do not use 'ownerid' or 'moderatorid' on anyone, else remove their auth and use the /permission command.
