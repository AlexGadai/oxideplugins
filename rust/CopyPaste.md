This will be an amelioration of my copy-paste plugin from legacy 
But for the Rust 2.0 
**Features:**

- Building paste **rotates** depending on your **eyes' angle**

- Save all **Deployables

Commands:**
- /copy NAME => copy the building, the building part that you will choose will serve as structure 0 for when you paste it (so be careful of which part you look at while you use this command)
- /paste NAME optional:HeightAdjustment => paste a building
- /placeback NAME => placeback a building where it was when it was saved
**To Do list:**

- Auto detect the best height where to paste the building.
