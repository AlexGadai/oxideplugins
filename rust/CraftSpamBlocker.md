If a player's inventory is full, the item is not crafted and a message is displayed in chat.


At this time, resources are still consumed when they attempt to craft with a full inventory.


This is meant to help prevent players from spamming the server with dropped crafted items if their inventory is full.

**Thanks to CCTV and RHAKOON for requesting the plugin!**
