No idea if i will be updating this plugin or not,

it's mainly to give ideas to other plugin devs.

Green dots are online players

Orange dots are NPCs

Red dots are offline players

**Command:**

- /radar optional:XX => shows radar in XXm radius (default is 500m!!!)

- /radar => activate / deactivate radar
**Sleepers**:

Be carefull, if you have too much sleepers it might (because i don't know) reduce the server performance, especially if multiple people use the plugin.

So either dont use the Slow Sleepers, or increase the refresh speed (1s maybe)
**Config:**
