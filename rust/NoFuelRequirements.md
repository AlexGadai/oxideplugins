**Feedback**

Any feedback is welcome, whether it be ideas and suggestions, bug reports, or just to tell me I coded it wrong. Tell me what I did wrong, and I'll fix it. Want something new? If I can do it I will.

**Notes**


* Just a quick note on how this works, it requires that one single item is added as fuel, it won't ever use it however. How this works is, whenever it goes to consume fuel, it adds 1 fuel before it takes a single fuel away. This doesn't cause duping because it's so fast, but this was the cleanest easiest way to make things infinite fuel while still making burnable items like charcoal.


**Features**


* Allows you to set if campfires, lanterns, pumpkins, small and large furnaces, miners hat & candle hat, and quarries use fuel or not.


**Commands**


* No commands.


**Permissions**
