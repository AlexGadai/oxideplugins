What initially started as a small snippet requested [here ](http://oxidemod.org/threads/indestructible-foundations.7388/)was now turned into an actual plugin per request.


The plugin allows server owners to block damage to foundations or buildings on the entire server and to inform the player on this when he/she tries to deal damage to it.


The plugin doesn't offer any in-game or console commands and is configurable through a configuration file.
