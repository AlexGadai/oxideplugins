**This is an API plugin that doesnt do anything alone besides managing an ignore list. To make use of that youo need another plugin using it.


Usage:**

Chat commands:

/ignore <add(+)/remove(-)> <name/steamID> to add or remove someone

/ignore list to show your ignore list

**Usage for plugin devs**

To call the functions from this API your plugin needs to get the plugin instance.
Code (C#):
````
[PluginReference]
private Plugin Ignore;

Code (Lua):
````
var added = Ignore.Call("AddIgnore", playerSteamId, targetSteamId)
````
