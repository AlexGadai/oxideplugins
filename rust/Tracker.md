Well basically, this plugin is to get the location of any container or player that has certain item ( with/without a minimum amount), i wrote it for fun couple weeks ago and i decided to released it now.

**ConsoleCommands:**
trackitemcount - Will give you the total amount in game of certain items, example ( /trackitemcount "timed explosive charge" => There is X timed explosive charges in game).

trackitem - Will track every container, player or both and print the location and amount.

**Usage:**
trackitemcount item

trackitem item optional:place optional:minamount

Place: chests/players/all
Minimun Amount: Default is 0


Overall this is pretty simple to use and fun aswell.
