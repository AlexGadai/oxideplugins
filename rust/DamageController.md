Well basically you can control any damage that will be applied in buildings, players, animals and barricades. You can increase, decrease or even remove them.

At the moment it has support just for that 4 entities, but i shall add more if necessary ( i did this for myself but i feel like other ppl will use aswell ), and i did this just to control C4 damage over buildings ( with 500x configuration in my server, they make c4s easily so its more to control that ).


There is no commands, the config file is really easy to work on and ye thats pretty much it.


If you enjoy my plugins, donate to support new updates/plugins!
