SyringeDenerf is a plugin meant to restore usefulness to syringes by overriding the default heal amounts.


The instant heal amount is set to 25hp, and an additional 10hp is healed over the next 10 seconds.


Since I cannot recall the exact amounts the syringes healed prior to the nerf, please let me know if the numbers are slightly off and I can update accordingly, or you can update the plugin directly.
