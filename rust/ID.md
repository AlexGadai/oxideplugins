This is a very very basic plugin I made after countless complaints/confusion on my own server when players struggle with some plugins that rely on them entering a friend's name, especially if an awkward name or unusual characters are in it.

**Chat Command:**


* 
**/id** playername

The player name can be partial, so "[BUM] S4usg3Munch3r" could be abbreviated to S4us.


Then you can use the returned Steam ID in place of the name for most other plugin commands. This has helped people on my server when adding friends with the Friends API or admins when using the ChangeOwner plugin.
