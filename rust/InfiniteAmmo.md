Players with the permission **infinite.ammo** will not lose any ammunition or condition when firing a weapon.


To grant this permission to a player, i.e. me, use the following console command:
**oxide.grant user "Mughisi" "infinite.ammo"
**

Or to grant this permission to a group, i.e. the admin group:
**oxide.grant group "admin" "infinite.ammo"**
