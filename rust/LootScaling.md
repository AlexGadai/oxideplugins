This plugin allows you to adjust loot spawn rate and density by the percentage of players on your server from 10% when empty to 100% when full.


You can edit the script to change which loot categories are subject to the scaling. This should work with loot table mods as long as they aren't replacing the original loot container spawning code.


The script is set by default to scale spawn rate/density for roadside and structure loot.


Supply drops are not affected.
