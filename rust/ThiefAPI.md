This plugin is designed to create a thief class to create roleplay.

**Current functions:**


* Permission: ThiefAPI.can
* Toggle via: /lp
* Wipe Cooldown data /lpwipe

* Opens code locks that are not known to player
* Normal behavior when opening code lock known to player
* Chance system included
* Damage system when players fail pick


**Planned functions:**


* Add Material cost to opening doors
* Add Time requirements to pick lock (partially integrated)
* Add more permissions (eg Admin Mode, Cooldown reduction)

Cooldown:

Default is set to 25 seconds, If you have a recommended value for  Cooldown time let me know in the chat.
Damage:

Damage is dealt every 0.2 seconds, This can not be changed.

Damage per tick is 0.2 hp, Default quantity is 50 ticks.

These settings mean players recieve 10hp of damage in 10 seconds.
