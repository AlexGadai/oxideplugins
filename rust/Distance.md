Distance measuring tool - useful for setting up zones.

**Features:**

- Calculates distance between two points

- Rangefinder mode determines distance to what you are looking at

- Stores the last five (5) distances measured

- Calculating distance or showing history will draw lines in-game between the reference points, with a corresponding text display over the midpoint of each line

**Usage (chat commands):**
/distance origin - Set origin to current position
/distance get - Calculate distance to origin
/distance rf - Calculate distance to target (rangefinder)
/distance history - Show last 5 distances measured
/distance clear [origin|history|all] - Clear origin, history, or all (both)

**Planned improvements:**

- Set up customizations/configuration

- Increase history size

- Include more data in history

- Allow deletion of individual history entries

- "Live" rangefinding

- More cool features

**Known issues/bugs:**

- Rangefinding to structures displays generic "Construction" tag

- Rangefinding into certain locations within landmarks can be inaccurate (eg, into a sewer)

- Some item names are not particularly useful
