When a player uses the built in hammer menu to demolish a structure the build cost is refunded.

If they demolish an item that was not built with the Planner (eg High External Walls etc) then the item is returned to their inventory. The ability to demolish non planner items via the hammer menu was removed in a recent Rust update.


Since this plugin is based off the built in Demolish function it is not susceptible to the abuse that plagues other removal / refund plugins.


This plugin was designed to be as simple as possible to make it performant and bug resistant.
