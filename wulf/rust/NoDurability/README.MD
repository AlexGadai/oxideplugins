**NoDurability**  allows players with permission to have no durability on every item, essentially lasting forever. I may add the ability to customize which items are included in the future as well as a chat command to toggle it.

**Permissions** 

This plugin uses Oxide's permission system. To assign a permission, use **grant user <username|steamid> <permission>** . To remove a permission, use **revoke user <username|steamid> <permission>** .


* nodurability.allowed (allows player's items to last forever)
