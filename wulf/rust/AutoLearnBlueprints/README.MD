A very simple plugin to make players automatically learn specific blueprints.


You may use the "bps.update" console command to force all currently online players to learn the blueprints you specify. Otherwise, they will be learned when the player connects to the server.

**Default Config:** 

````
{

  "DefaultBlueprints": [

    "lock.code",

    "pistol.revolver",

    "ammo.pistol",

  ]

}
