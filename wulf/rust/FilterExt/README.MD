**FilterExt**  is an extension to Oxide's filter for removing unwanted messages from your server console. Keep in mind that while this may help cleanup your console view, it's best to resolve warnings and errors instead of hiding them.


Currently there is no configuration, and I'm not sure there will be given that nature of the plugin. To filter a message, just add a line like the existing ones in the plugin with the partial or complete message you'd like to filter.
