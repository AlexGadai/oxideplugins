**Analytics**  allows for real-time collection and reporting of player locations to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

**Configuration** 

The only option to configure is the [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) tracking ID that you'd like to use. You can configure the Tracking ID in the Analytics.json file under the server/identity/oxide/config directory.

**Default Configuration** 

````
{

Â  "TrackingId": "UA-XXXXXXXX-Y"

}
````

The configuration file will update automatically if new options are added or removed. I'll do my best to preserve any existing settings and messages with each new version.
