**Whitelist**  restricts access to your server, only allowing players who have the 'whitelist.allowed' permission from Oxide.

**Permissions** 

This plugin uses Oxide's permission system. To assign a permission, use **grant user <username|steamid> <permission>** . To remove a permission, use **revoke user <username|steamid> <permission>** .


* whitelist.allowed (allows player to connect to the server)
Ex. grant user Wulf whitelist.allowed
Ex. revoke user Wulf whitelist.allowed

**Localization** 

The default messages are in the Whitelist.en.json under the oxide/lang directory, or create a language file for another language using the 'en' file as a default.
