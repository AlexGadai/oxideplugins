Create custom recipes for every item!

**Intro:**

Alter is a plugin that allows you to edit the resources needed for set item. For example. If you want an M4 that cost 50 Low Quality Metal instead of 30, you can do that!


You can also configure your own crafting time, per item ofcourse.

**How does it work?**

When first starting the server with the new Alter plugin, you'll need, as admin, configure your desireable items. 


For example: A M4 cost 30 Low Quality Metal; to chance this do:

/alter "M4" "Low Quality Metal" 50

/alter "M4" "wood" 10

/alterct 20


Now it costs 50 Low Quality Metal AND 10 Wood to make a M4, it will also take 20 seconds of your time.


When trying to craft the item, the plugin will search if the item's recipe is changed. If it is, it will try to consume all the required resources. If one resource does fail, all the consumed resources will be placed back, and the message will pop up that you've not got enough resources. (The chat will display how many of what kind you'll need)


When you have all the resources, the plugin will check for a custom Crafting Time. ( If the crafting time is not set, it will be instant craft. I've not put in the default crafting times! ) When the crafting time is set, it will counttdown to 0, then give the items.

You're able to move, I could make it that you MUST stand still, but thats ALOT of work


I've tested it with a M4 custom recipe; I made it cost:


* 5 Wood planks
* 5 Wood
* 1 Camp Fire
* 1 Revolver
* 5 Arrrows
* 50 Low Quality Metal

Everything worked like it should've. So I dont think it is bugged or anything. Please let me know if this is false

**Disclaimer!**

this plugin is in BETA! Expect errors. I would be thankful if you guys send ANY error/bug/exploits to me! When they occurred is also a must. Provide a Oxidelog please!

**Feedback:**

I would greatly appreciate feedback!

Idea's are welcome!

Plugin programmer's can also give me feedback if I've done something stupid in the code. (and yes, there will be some stupid coding in there.)

**Donations: - STRICTLY OPTIONAL!**

I don't know if this is allowed, but I've seen some people willing to donate to the creator of certain plugins.

I do need to invest alot of time in making and probably updating this plugin. Also I have a personal server, just for testing this plugin. I would greatly appreciate it, but I certainly don't expect it.

Thanks, even if you only consider!
