Ever needed to restart or shut your server down for an update, some changes in the files or some other reason? This plugin will help you to set a timer on the original /restart and /shutdown commands.


RestartAnnouncer uses the commands /trestart and /tshutdown to wait the given number of minutes before executing it. On top of that, RestartAnnouncer also notifies the players how long till the restart/shutdown on times you can configure.

This can't be done by setting it in the ServerSettings.cfg(since this will require a restart on it's own).

**Usage:**

/trestart (time in minutes) - Waits given minutes before restarting the server while announcing.

/tshutdown (time in minutes) - Waits given minutes before shutting down the server while announcing.


Announce messages can be configured in the Lang folder (RestartAnnouncer.en.json).


The announces are preset at (can be edited in the config file):

- 1 hour

- 45 minutes

- 30 minutes

- 20 minutes

- 15 minutes

- 10 minutes

- 5 minutes

- 4 minutes

- 3 minutes

- 2 minutes

- 1 minute
