**Cupboard for Friends** only allows friends of already authorized people to authorize themselves at the cupboard. The plugin blocks strangers or raiders from authorizing at Cupboards of others,  if nobody of the already authorized people has the player in his friend list.

    "Blocked Authorization", "You can not authorize yourself or clear the list of this cupboard as none of the authorized players has you on his friendlist! You can be added as friend by typing /friend add <your name>",

    "Blocked Damage", "You can not damage this cupboard as none of the authorized players has you on his friendlist! You can be added as friend by typing /friend add <your name>"
}
